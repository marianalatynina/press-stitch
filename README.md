# About
_Press Stitch_ is a set of Python scripts for the Press Switch visual novels by Skeigh.

The scripts do not contain any of Skeigh's content. You have to download the zip file for v0.6a of Press Switch and the scripts will patch it.

# Current status
The script patches Press Switch 0.6a to use less memory when it runs. This can enable users with 4Gb of RAM to comfortably run the game. Memory usage typically drops from 3.9Gb to 2.1Gb.

# Patching the game

To patch the game:
1. Click on the latest release (on the right hand side of this page) and download the ZIP file. It will be named something like "press-stitch-v4.zip".
2. Download the `P-S-0.6a-pc.zip` file from [TFGames](https://tfgames.site/index.php?module=viewgame&id=282) if you don't already have it, and put it in the same folder as the "press-stitch" ZIP file that you downloaded in the first step.
3. Unzip `P-S-0.6a-pc.zip`
4. Unzip the "press-stitch" ZIP file. If asked, choose to overwrite files. This will patch the game.
5. You can now play the game as usual in the P-S-0.6a-pc folder.
